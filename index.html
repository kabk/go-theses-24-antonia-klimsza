              <h1 id="start"> Cabinets of Curiosities</h1>

              <h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

              <p class="text_introduction">
                Looking at and playing with small toys was something I loved when I was a kid. I had
                a whole collection of Schleich animals and my parents bought me a little vitrine where
                I kept them. It wasn’t really a cabinet of curiosities, but a collection of miniatures. This
                early interest of mine is what brought me to look closer at the origin of collecting.
                Since the Middle Stone Age, humans have been carrying items of value with them.
                Keeping resources for the future and being able to trade meant a more stable life – a
                good incentive to start to accumulate objects. However, since there are so many
                types of collections and collectors, a lot of theories exist on the reasons behind this
                routine.<sup><a href="#ref14" class="footnote">1</a></sup> </p>


              <p class="text_introduction">
                Of course, a lot of collections had to do with the showcase of wealth. People were
                collecting to gain admiration and respect from their community and to present their
                good taste. A collection was something like a status symbol, however, this high
                regard for collecting and the habit of exhibiting in museums was a very western
                development. In other cultures, collectors were perceived as hoarders, and nobody
                recognized the value of their collections.<sup><a href="#ref44" class="footnote">2</a></sup>
                Others find satisfaction in the hunt for the objects. Browsing flea markets and
                antiquity stores, negotiating a clever price and tracking down super rare pieces can
                feel more rewarding and fun than owning the object in the end.
              </p>
              <p class="text_introduction">
                Then there is the aspect of history and preservation. Many collectors have a feeling
                of nostalgia when looking at old objects and want to keep these memories, which can
                help to feel closer to one’s culture and ancestors. Historical collections also help us to
                understand what was valuable in different time periods.<sup><a href="#ref29"
                    class="footnote">3</a></sup>
                Another drive behind collecting is the community and network people get when
                starting this hobby. It is always nice to talk to peers with the same interest and to
                share one’s passion with like-minded people. Collecting here becomes a social
                activity.<sup><a href="#ref29" class="footnote">4</a></sup>
                A big purpose of collecting is also the educational aspect. Collectors put a lot of time
                and effort into their collections and by doing so, acquire a lot of knowledge about their topic of
                interest. Collecting therefore can be seen as the human process of
                trying to understand the world and make it one’s own.<sup><a href="#ref29" class="footnote">5</a></sup>
              </p>
              <p class="text_introduction">
                Conclusively it can be said that through the routine of collecting, humans are trying to
                connect: sometimes with themselves and in other cases with their community or the
                world around them. We are searching for a sense of belonging, our place in the world
                and deeper understanding of our own identity.<sup><a href="#ref14" class="footnote">6</a></sup>
                Sometimes, a collection can serve as
                a portal, transporting us into another world – be it the past, the future, or simply an
                alternate reality we wish to inhabit. This thesis will investigate how collections reflect
                our identities and visions of the world, starting with cabinets of curiosities.

              <p class="text_thesis">
                A little museum in a cabinet – that is how you could describe a Cabinet of Curiosities.
                Also called “Kunst- or Wunderkammer”, this form of collecting started mostly in
                northern Europe in the 16th and 17th century and its purpose was to amaze and wow
                the viewer.<sup><a href="#ref9" class="footnote">7</a></sup> The wonder rooms were filled with all
                kinds of objects, ranging from
                artworks and animals to scientific tools. There were no rules regarding the
                collections, however, the objects had one thing in common: they were rare, unusual,
                and felt exotic.

                Not all cabinets looked alike. While many pieces were displayed in real cabinets,
                drawers and shelfs, other collectors had whole rooms dedicated to their collections. It
                was men from the upper class who filled the cabinets: aristocrats, merchants and
                scientific scholars, and numerous collections would later become part of famous
                museums. The cabinets were the early stage of a modern museum.<sup><a href="#ref20"

                The book <i>Dell’Historia Naturale</i> by the apothecary Ferrante Imperato from 1599
                includes the earliest depiction of a cabinet.<sup><a href="#ref20" class="footnote">9</a></sup> The
                illustration shows a collection of
                natural history in Naples and one cannot fail to notice a huge crocodile hanging from
                the ceiling. The big reptile was a very popular and wanted object for such cabinets,
                since people were fascinated by the exotic animal. Similar to „freak shows“, the notion of exoticism was
                the selling point, and the crocodile is a good example of the
                feeling that pieces should evoke in the visitors: the big monster above their heads
                aroused interest, but also horror, and impressed everyone coming to the room.<sup><a href="#ref50"

                A lot of the wonder rooms had an educational purpose and were trying to explain the
                world truthfully through arranging the artefacts according to geography or another
                specific system.<sup><a href="#ref9" class="footnote">11</a></sup> In other cabinets, facts and myths
                mixed and they also contained
                fictional creatures.<sup><a href="#ref7" class="footnote">12</a></sup> The wonder rooms of emperor
                Rudolf II in Prague for example
                featured paintings of mythical creatures like dragons and unicorns.<sup><a href="#ref20"

                Back then, it was believed that a narwhal’s tusk was the horn of a unicorn and had
                medical powers, and the “unicorn horn” was therefore proudly exhibited in wonder
                rooms. Worm doubted this, since he had never seen it attached to a skull, and later
                recognized that the horns belonged to narwhals.<sup><a href="#ref28" class="footnote">14</a></sup>
                However, he also believed in the Scythian Lamb (also called the Vegetable Lamb of
                Tartary), an animal-plant that would have sheep as fruit and based this on a soft plant
                in his collection.<sup><a href="#ref46" class="footnote">15</a></sup>

              <p class="text_thesis">
                In general, the objects in a wonder room were classified in two main categories,
                <i>naturalia</i> and <i>artificialia,</i><sup><a href="#ref9" class="footnote">16</a></sup> both Latin
                terms.

                <i>Naturalia</i> contained everything existing in
                nature, like skeletons and stuffed animals, plant examples and fossils. It was also
                popular to create and believe in monsters and rare creatures. Collectors achieved
                this through combining and arranging different parts of animals together. A
                subcategory belonging to <i>naturalia</i> was <i>exotica,</i> which described exotic and rare
                objects from faraway.<sup><a href="#ref9" class="footnote">17</a></sup>
                They were often collected on journeys and were used to
                show off how well educated and well-traveled the owner was. Everyone was drawn to
                luxurious objects, and a cabinet full of exotic things was perfect for entertaining
                guests and telling stories about adventures in foreign lands. Sometimes these stories
                were not true though, and the admired items were coming from flea markets instead
                of dangerous trips.<sup><a href="#ref41" class="footnote">18</a></sup>
              </p>
              <p class="text_thesis">
                The category <i>artificialia </i>consisted of human made objects like art, cultural antiquities
                and different scientific tools. These science related objects were also called <i>scientifica</i> and
                were very
                respected since the knowledge around it was quite new and
                people were fascinated by its wonders. Another big reason for
                the popularity of <i>scientifica</i> and the wonder rooms in general was its display of the
                power of men over the natural world.<sup><a href="#ref9" class="footnote">19</a></sup>
                Collectors could arrange the objects how they wished and thus, create their own
                world. The act of putting the whole universe in a cabinet made them feel superior and
                like the master of the planet. Humans always try to find correlations between and
                explanations for things happening in the world and we do not like to admit that we do
                not understand everything. Cabinets of curiosities therefore also had the function of
                making the world seem smaller and less complicated than it is.<sup><a href="#ref41"
                    class="footnote">20</a></sup> Were cabinets
                maybe the beginning of mansplaining?

              </p>

              <p class="text_thesis">
                However, as innocent as the cabinets seem, they are very much connected to
                Europe’s colonial past and were driven by the desire to understand and own the
                whole world.<sup><a href="#ref27" class="footnote">21</a></sup> A lot of the unique objects and specimen
                were found on colonial trade
                routes, taken from local inhabitants while not understanding its real cultural history
                and meaning. The collectors portrayed and organized the objects with their personal
                perspective on the world in mind, which gave them the control to decide what should
                be considered as relevant and valuable. These very subjective decisions, biased by
                the amount of knowledge they had and how many places they had visited, still have implications today.
                Parts of famous cabinets belong to big museums now and we still
                can see and feel the outdated hierarchies and a colonial standpoint.<sup><a href="#ref48"
                    class="footnote">22</a></sup> For instance,
                museums exhibit art that is considered prestigious and art that is called “primitive”,
                often coming from colonized cultures and presented with little understanding about
                their traditions.

                A collection that benefited immensely from colonialism and slavery is the one of Sir
                Hans Sloane, a famous British physician and a well-known collector. He accumulated
                over 71,000 items, which later became the foundation of the British Museum. Most of
                his exotic specimen came from Jamaica, a British colony, where he worked as a
                doctor. He owes a lot of his success and knowledge to the enslaved people from
                West Africa, who helped him in his search. He also married Elizabeth Langley Rose,
                the widow of a plantation owner in Jamaica, which meant that he was directly
                profiting from slavery and could continue with his career.<sup><a href="#ref39"

                Another way of thinking inherited from the cabinets is the division between naturalia
                and artificialia, which became stronger in the 18th century and led to a disconnection

                When writing about cabinets of curiosities, it is not possible to oversee how similar
                cabinet dollhouses from the 17th century look. Originally, these were not intended for
                kids to play with: instead, they were used to display wealth and could be seen as an
                alternative to the classic wonder rooms for female collectors.<sup><a href="#ref19"

                Dollhouses appeared in the 16th century in northern Europe, mostly in Germany, the
                Netherlands and England, and were a status symbol for the upper class.
                While referred to as “Dockenhaus” in Germany, which meant “miniature house”, the
                Dutch called their models “cabinet houses”. This is a very fitting name, since the
                houses were built in wooden China cabinets, that were opening at the front and could
                be locked.<sup><a href="#ref2" class="footnote">30</a></sup>

                They rarely were depictions of one’s own house, only the tradition of “baby houses” in
                England in the 18th century showed a miniature of the real owner’s house, also called
                Victorian Houses. Dollhouses only became a common toy and an object for kids after
                the industrial revolution and with the start of mass production, which made them
                affordable for normal households. They are still very popular among kids, the hype
                around the Barbie dream house and Polly pocket toys shows this very well.<sup><a href="#ref8"
                    class="footnote">31</a></sup>

                The fascination for dollhouses does not end with childhood though, there are enough
                adult fans who collect or even build their own models and companies like Mulvany &
                Rogers sell exquisite models worth £50,000 for serious buyers.<sup><a href="#ref24"
                    class="footnote">32</a></sup>
                However, it is
                important to delve into the dollhouses from a gender perspective and to understand
                the female role in it.

                Many dollhouses were used for educational purposes for young

                </span>
                A modified version of classic dollhouses are “Nuremberg kitchens”, which were made
                to teach girls how to use a kitchen. Instead of multiple floors, Nuremberg kitchens
                consisted of a single room with a kitchen set and a lot of pots, pans and other
                necessary objects. They were mostly made from metal and produced in Germany. It
                was a clever way to get girls excited about the kitchen space, which was maybe even
                more important than the practical household skills. Clearly, not all girls automatically
                thought of their role as caretaker or in the kitchen. Through the captivating miniature
                model, women learned to see the kitchen as a space for play and delight and
                accepted the traditional heteronormative future expectations.<sup><a href="#ref32"

                The cabinet houses from the 17th century were an object of luxury and were thought
                through down to every single detail. They included different materials and
                handcrafted pieces, and the rooms were as richly decorated as real interiors. This detailed perfection
                on small scale was what fascinated the viewers and made it
                a popular hobby for Dutch women of the wealthy class.<sup><a href="#ref43" class="footnote">34</a></sup>

                In general, women were expected to spend money wisely and only for domestic
                reasons. It was usually seen as their husband’s money and the expenses were also
                overlooked by the husband. Men also believed in a female desire to spend money
                and therefore guidelines and handbooks for women which warned about
                unnecessary spending and gave tips on how to properly manage finances were
                common.<sup><a href="#ref43" class="footnote">35</a></sup> The expensive dollhouses were an exception
                and an opportunity for privileged
                women to show their ability to control money and make autonomous decisions. It was
                probably accepted since the hobby was very much connected to domestic life and
                the models showed ideal households.<sup><a href="#ref43" class="footnote">36</a></sup>
                The perfectly organized house demonstrated
                how well women understood and ran the household, that they had a feeling for
                quality and craft as well as a good taste in interior design and decoration.<sup><a href="#ref43"
                    class="footnote">37</a></sup>
                Not surprisingly though, dollhouses were sometimes still criticized and presented as
                lavish spending. Despite the craft being of high quality and even though they had
                much in common with the famous cabinets of curiosities, they were never taken as
                seriously as the collections of men at that time.<sup><a href="#ref43" class="footnote">38</a></sup>

                Like in a “Kunstkammer”, the splendid interior of dollhouses was filled with
                extravagant materials: silver, ivory, lace, silk, marble and porcelain, some of it coming
                from trade made in and around colonies.<sup><a href="#ref43" class="footnote">39</a></sup>
                The little objects were often crafted by the same people who would also create
                regular size versions. Paintings for example were made by artists and miniature
                books were real books that you could flick through and read.<sup><a href="#ref30"
                    class="footnote">40</a></sup>
                The dollhouse of Lita de Ranitz for instance, which was built in 1910 in The Hague,
                had a guestbook with a signature of Queen Emma on the front page.
                The paintings in the miniature villa came from famous painters Lita de Ranitz was
                friends with, like Toorop, Gabriel, Mauve, Jongkind and Arntzenius.<sup><a href="#ref25"

                Another parallel to the cabinet of curiosities is the creation of a microcosm – and the
                control over it. The miniature houses make people behave differently. You must bend
                over if you want to see more precisely, and you have to minimize your movements in
                order not to break anything. The creator knew the house very well of course and
                therefore could interact effortlessly.<sup><a href="#ref30" class="footnote">42</a></sup> Miniature
                models also change the perception of
                time and make viewers think that more time has passed since starting to look at the
                dollhouse.<sup><a href="#ref30" class="footnote">43</a></sup> This means, as Susan Stewart writes in her
                book “On Longing”, that
                miniatures slow down or even stop time and make space for infinite daydreams.<sup><a href="#ref44"
                    class="footnote">44</a></sup> In my opinion, that is why kids can spend hours playing with a
                dollhouse, miniature toys

                You can create all the scenarios you want and are able to rearrange and redecorate
                anytime you become tired of your fantasy universe. I remember building houses for
                my dolls out of my duvet, which never turned out the same, and the process of
                creating and deciding what should be where was what made playing with them
                exciting. Dollhouses allowed women to arrange a house and hence their own world in a way
                they wished it to be – for once, they were the rule makers. Gaston Bachelard writes
                in Poetics of Space:

              <p id="quote" class="text_thesis">

              </p>
              <p class="text_thesis">
                This describes very well why dollhouses could be seen as a chance for
                independence: they gave women full control over a little universe and at the same
                time were a place for imagination.<sup><a href="#ref4" class="footnote">45</a></sup>

                If you take a “Wunderkammer” and a dollhouse and put them together, you will get a
                house of curiosities. As already mentioned, cabinets of curiosities sometimes were
                bigger than a piece of furniture, they took the form of rooms and in some cases, even
                of a whole house.
                One good example for that is the house of Sir John Soane, a successful British
                architect and collector of art and architecture. His interest in Classical art started on
                his Grand Tour (which was very common for wealthy young men at that time), where
                he visited ancient cities in Italy and Greece. He bought and reworked three
                neighboring houses in London for the display of his growing collection, that consists of paintings,
                books, drawings, architectural models and sculptures ranging in size. It
                is not only the amount of collected pieces that is impressive, but also the whole
                house also (which was turned into a museum) is an adventure to walk through. Each
                room looks completely different but is always packed with art and sculptures. The
                three buildings are connected through corridors, and secret doors and weird lighting
                make you feel like in a labyrinth. Even though it could appear like a house without
                any order, Soane thought a lot about the placement of the objects and recomposed
                the rooms often to find new connections between the art pieces.<sup><a href="#ref33"
                    class="footnote">46</a></sup> As impressive as
                this house is, we should keep in mind that also here colonialism was a big factor that helped Soane to
                acquire all these objects and that he projected his western view on
                the artworks. I doubt for example, that the sarcophagus of the Egyptian Pharaoh Seti
                I., which is one of the biggest pieces in Soane’s Musuem, would be exhibited in the
                same way in Egypt.

                Another famous House Museum is the <i>Museum of Innocence</i> in Istanbul by the
                novelist Orhan Pamuk. He had the idea to write a novel and to create a museum as
                its counterpart. Both tell the love story of Kemal and Füsun, two people living in
                Istanbul in the 70s and 80s. The museum consists of everyday objects belonging to
                the characters in the novel, for example an earring Füsun drops, or kitchen ware their
                families would use. The author collected the items throughout the years on flea
                markets and antiquity stores and it was important to him that they were authentic and
                that they represented the real Istanbul of that time. Through showing objects his
                audience knows very well and can relate to, the story comes more alive. The pieces are exhibited in
                carefully arranged boxes and vitrines, and Pamuk himself said that
                the idea was coming from the classic “Wunderkammer”. Each vitrine contains a
                composition of objects that tell a part of the story.<sup><a href="#ref43" class="footnote">47</a></sup>
                In the catalogue of his museum
                called <i>The Innocence of Objects,</i> Pamuk writes about how he figured out that when
                objects are taken out of their normal surrounding and composed together, they start
                to interact and get a new meaning.<sup><a href="#ref43" class="footnote">48</a></sup>
                He also wrote a short manifesto for museums where he argues that the future should
                focus on smaller and cheaper museums, instead of big institutions representing the
                state. Point 3 of this manifesto states:
              </p>
              <p id="quote" class="text_thesis">
                <i>“… We all know that the ordinary, everyday stories of
                  individuals are richer,
                  more humane, and much more joyful. “</i><br>

                The domestic sphere and collecting of curiosities are very much intertwined. One
                could see living rooms as cabinets of curiosities, decorated with items that we got as
                gifts, objects we find fascinating or aesthetically pleasing and things we bought on
                trips, reminding us of the places we visited. These souvenirs are the modern
                equivalent to the exotic artefacts in wonder rooms. Buying cultural objects without
                knowing its meaning and using them in another context is cultural appropriation.
                Unfortunately, a lot of fake souvenirs are sold which are not authentically made by
                the native population. In some cases, objects are even sold in the wrong region or
                country, and tourist have no clue about their real point of origin.<sup><a href="#ref22"

                There is also a trend in interior design that you can observe in trendy cafes or homes
                from celebrities, where you can find unusual and quirky deco objects displayed.
                Sometimes there is a backstory to it – and sometimes the object’s purpose is only to
                intrigue. In both cases, only the person living in the space can tell the visitors more
                about it.<sup><a href="#ref22" class="footnote">50</a></sup> Further, there are designed bookcases that
                resemble cabinets of
                curiosities which are made solely to present decorative items.<sup><a href="#ref15"
                    class="footnote">51</a></sup>
                Surrounding ourselves with objects we like or are fascinated by makes sense though,
                because people we invite to our house immediately get a sense of who we are.
                Teenage bedrooms are probably the most drastic example here: walls filled with
                posters and crazy wallpapers almost scream the identity of the resident when
                entering the room. Architectural historian Gillian Darley for example describes Sir
                John Soane’s House Museum as an autobiography<sup><a href="#ref12" class="footnote">52</a></sup> and
                Orhan Pamuk argues that
                some collectors only collect to create a new identity for themselves.<sup><a href="#ref43"

                A house most people have heard about is the Villa Kunterbunt, the weird and
                wonderful home of Pippi Langstrumpf. In her article <i>“The Collection of Wonders –
                  Pippi Longstocking’s Cabinet of Curiosities”,</i> Elina Druker compares Pippi’s Home to
                a “Wunderkammer”. The chaotic house is filled with everyday objects as well as
                exotic artefacts: seashells, eggs, porcelain figures, pearl necklaces and numerous paintings collected
                from journeys Pippi and her missing father went on. These
                peculiar objects mirror Pippi’s peculiar character and underline her crazy stories
                about travel adventures from her past. Whether these stories are based on truth or
                fiction does not matter, just like in real curiosity cabinets. After entering Villa
                Kunterbunt, the inside and the outside world mix and visitors get to see Pippi’s
                version of it, the one she uniquely created for herself.<sup><a href="#ref17"
                    class="footnote">54</a></sup> When entering these houses
                be it in novels, film or in a museum, one understands that they all present their own
                microcosms.

                The motif of the wonder room is very common again and can be found referenced in
                a lot of contemporary artworks. Some people also call it the Wonder Room
                Renaissance.<sup><a href="#ref1" class="footnote">55</a></sup> An artist who uses wonder cabinets often
                in his work is Mark Dion. He is interested in
                the way we see and collect nature and how we present the findings of the natural
                world. Through his installations, he is questioning the current narration and display
                techniques in big museums and institutions and is introducing a new, more playful
                and interactive way of exploring and gaining knowledge. His aim is to encourage the
                viewers to think and engage with information, rather than letting them just be passive
                consumers.<sup><a href="#ref26" class="footnote">56</a></sup>

                Another contemporary cabinet was the exhibition <i>“The Cranbrook Hall of Wonders:
                  Artworks, Objects, and Natural Curiosities”</i> by Laura Mott and Shelley Selim at the
                Cranbrook Art Museum. Instead of a classic vitrine they used a modular system to
                display the different objects, so that visitors could see the pieces from different
                angles. They argued that these changing compositions create new relations
                between the objects when walking around the installation. The curators also added a
                new element to the old “Wunderkammer” concept: living performances, which
                contrasted the still life.<sup><a href="#ref38" class="footnote">57</a></sup>

                Going back to the concept of the curiosity cabinet is a solution of museums, curators,
                and artists for presenting knowledge in a more and more complex world. Museums
                understood that there is not just one way to look at a topic, and an exhibition in the
                style of a wonder room offers a more open and interactive way of exploring.<sup><a href="#ref1"
                    class="footnote">60</a></sup> When
                first starting this thesis, I was not very enthusiastic about cabinets of curiosities, since
                I was looking at them as another western colonial tradition. While I stress that
                everyone using a curiosity display should be aware of the colonial history it carries, I
                now also understand the potential of this type of collection and that it can activate the
                imagination in a more funny and inclusive way. An exhibition in the style of a cabinet
                lets viewers make their own connections between objects and discourses and there
                is not just one fixed interpretation of the subject.<sup><a href="#ref1" class="footnote">61</a></sup>

                metaphors within the objects and can even create their own collections of artworks in

                This multiplicity and not being satisfied with just one view comes from being used to
                the digital world.<sup><a href="#ref1" class="footnote">63</a></sup> We are living in a time where we
                can look up everything, can
                consume news and images from the whole world and are able to compare different
                sources – all of which leads to being overwhelmed and makes it impossible to keep
                an overview of everything. The wonder room is a good tool for showing complicated
                connections visually and making people understand little fragments of today’s world.
                The internet not only changed our consumption of information, but it could also be
                perceived as a platform for a new kind of cabinet of curiosities.<sup><a href="#ref1"
                    class="footnote">64</a></sup>
                We all have private
                collections on Pinterest and Instagram and are saving files in our folders, sometimes
                with a very precise folder structure. As in the historic cabinet, we are also collecting
                things we consider beautiful and unique. For some people it is fashion inspiration,
                others have folders full of recipes and screenshots from movies. We therefore again
                build a little personal world of things we like, a digital universe to our liking, our
                bubble. The cabinet becomes the bubble of curiosities.
                Whether analogue or digital, we like to collect things that matter to us and that help
                us to build or understand our identity. Nevertheless, we shouldn’t just stay in our
                familiar bubble, but also try to be open to other people’s cabinets – the purpose of a
                wonder room overall was not only to collect, but also to show and share these ideas. In the digital
                space, a development towards shared cabinets could support
                community and would resolve in collections not being biased by one person.

                One platform that comes to my mind is <i>are.na,</i> where users can collect and save
                images they like. The items are usually linked to its original source, and you can also
                see in what other collections they appear. This cross-referencing makes the search
                and collecting experience fair, respectful, and interactive. The biggest difference
                though is that the digital cabinet here is not closed off. You can access other cabinets
                from it, and thus new concepts and contradicting ideas. This hints to a universe that
                is bigger than one’s own collection, and in my opinion a healthy way to acknowledge
                that we do not understand and cannot collect the whole world.
              </p>
              <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
              <p class="text_introduction">
                Upon exploring the different forms of curiosity cabinets, we can see a clear pattern of
                collecting being tightly connected to our worldviews, whether the rational world or the
                fantasy one in our dreams.
                We collect things from our environment that we regard as beautiful or significant to
                us, and that captivate us in one way or another. We keep them to feel closer to
                ourselves, to understand the world around us and to also show other people our
                identity. Through arranging our collections in cabinets, rooms and houses, we are
                building our own little universe in which we decide the rules and where we feel safe.
                These individual microcosms give us space for reverie and allow us to imagine
                different worlds and alternative paths. I think that this escapism to a world where
                everything is possible is important and can help to recharge energy and be creative.
                However, in order not to just stay in our bubble and hide in our microcosm from the
                real world, our wonder rooms never should be completely done, but instead stay
                ready for redecoration, new ideas, change and development. The doors from our
                cabinets should stay wide open.</p>
